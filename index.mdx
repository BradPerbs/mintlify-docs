## Introduction

GeoGen is a Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) platform built for businesses that want to dominate AI search. Unlike traditional SEO tools that optimize only for Google organic search results, GeoGen analyzes how large language models like ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity and others currently respond to your brand and competitors.

Powered by multiple LLMs responses, GeoGen runs automated checks daily, identifies brand mentions, citations, and rank in the responses. Agencies use it to offer GEO as a new revenue stream, while brands use it to future-proof their discoverability across conversational AI platforms.

Put simply: If SEO was built for search engines, GEO is built for AI engines, and GeoGen is the tool that makes it happen.

## What we Actually do

GeoGen answers one simple question: When a customer asks an AI for help, does your business get mentioned?

We uncover your brand's true position in the new AI dialogue, whether people are asking about your industry, your specific products, or the problems you're known for solving.

Our platform is designed for anyone who needs this intelligence. Use it to understand your rank within AI models, to improve your visibility via the insights provided, to verify your brand's reputation or as an agency to deliver critical insights across a portfolio of clients.

We measure your impact in two fundamental ways:

**Direct Endorsements:** The AI names your company as a direct answer or recommendation.

**Content Influence:** Your website is used as a source to build an answer, positioning you as an authority even without a direct mention.

Our system queries multiple AI models every single day. This provides you with a constant stream of data, showing you precisely how often you appear and where you stand against your competitors.

## How we Collect Responses AI Responses Data

Here’s what makes our data different, and more accurate.

Most analytics tools pull data using APIs. Think of this as a special back-door for computers to talk to each other. It's clean, but it isn't always what a real person sees.

Peec AI doesn't use APIs. Instead, our technology interacts with AI models the same way a customer does: by visiting the website, typing a question into the chat box, and reading the answer on the screen.

This "human" approach gives us a few major advantages:

**You See What Your Customers See:** We capture the exact, unfiltered responses that are shown to a live user, not a sanitized version sent through a developer's API.

**True-to-Life Data:** Our results reflect the real-world experience, warts and all. What you see in our reports is what your customers are seeing in their browsers.

**Wider AI Coverage:** This method allows us to test almost any AI model, even those that don't have a public API or only offer limited access.

The bottom line is you get a truer picture of your brand's presence in AI.

  Instead of relying on APIs or theoretical outputs, GeoGen mimics an actual user asking questions inside AI tools. We capture the responses exactly as they appear on screen, the same way your customers would see them.

## API Calls VS Web Responses Scraping 

### The API Calls way

Here's a big problem with how most AI analytics tools work: they rely on official APIs.

Think of an API as a private, direct line to the AI's brain. It's clean and fast, but it has some serious blind spots that can give you a distorted view of reality.

**First:** the answers it provides often don't match what people see on the actual website. An answer from the API might be structured differently or leave out important details that a real user gets in the public chat interface.

**Second:** the sources the AI cites can be completely different. The API might reference one set of links, while a user asking the same question sees another. This means you're not getting a true picture of the information being used to form the AI's opinion.

But here’s the biggest issue: the API is often pulling from a static, outdated library of information. It doesn't perform a live web search. So, if you've been working hard to improve your content and boost your visibility, an API-based tool won't see any of it until the entire model is retrained months later. You have no way of knowing if your efforts are paying off.

The bottom line is that if your data comes from an API, you're not just seeing a different answer, you're likely seeing an old one. You're not seeing what your customers are seeing right now.

### Web Responses Scraping

At GeoGen, our approach is built on a simple premise: to see what your customers see, you have to act like one.

That’s why we don’t use APIs.

Instead of using a private back-channel, our platform interacts with AI models through their public front door, the same web interface your customers use every day. We automate browsers to ask questions and capture the results directly from the screen.

This commitment to replicating the real user experience delivers a fundamentally better class of data:

**You get the ground truth.** The data we provide isn't a filtered or slightly different version from an API. It's an exact mirror of what your audience sees, giving you total confidence in its accuracy.

**Our system is built to last.** Because we don't depend on APIs, our ability to gather intelligence isn't affected by a company's decision to change, restrict, or remove its API access. We are independent and resilient.

This technical difference is our strategic advantage. It ensures the insights you get from GeoGen are a true reflection of your brand's position in the real world.
