## Introduction

GeoGen is a Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) platform built for businesses that want to dominate AI search. Unlike traditional SEO tools that optimize only for Google organic search results, GeoGen analyzes how large language models like ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity and others currently respond to your brand and competitors.

Powered by multiple LLMs responses, GeoGen runs automated checks daily, identifies brand mentions, citations, and rank in the responses. Agencies use it to offer GEO as a new revenue stream, while brands use it to future-proof their discoverability across conversational AI platforms.

Put simply: If SEO was built for search engines, GEO is built for AI engines, and GeoGen is the tool that makes it happen.

## What we Actually do

GeoGen answers one simple question: When a customer asks an AI for help, does your business get mentioned?

We uncover your brand's true position in the new AI dialogue, whether people are asking about your industry, your specific products, or the problems you're known for solving.

Our platform is designed for anyone who needs this intelligence. Use it to understand your rank within AI models, to improve your visibility via the insights provided, to verify your brand's reputation or as an agency to deliver critical insights across a portfolio of clients.

We measure your impact in two fundamental ways:

Direct Endorsements: The AI names your company as a direct answer or recommendation.

Content Influence: Your website is used as a source to build an answer, positioning you as an authority even without a direct mention.

Our system queries multiple AI models every single day. This provides you with a constant stream of data, showing you precisely how often you appear and where you stand against your competitors.
