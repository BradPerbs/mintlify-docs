# What are Query Fanouts?

**Query Fanouts** are the web search queries that AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google Gemini execute when generating responses to user prompts. When a user asks an AI a question, the model often performs real-time web searches to gather up-to-date information before formulating its answer.

<Info>
Query Fanouts give you unprecedented visibility into *how* AI models research your brand, competitors, and industry topics in real-time.

## How Query Fanouts Work

When users ask AI assistants questions like *"What's the best project management tool?"* or *"Compare Monday.com vs Asana"*, the AI doesn't always rely solely on its training data. Instead, many modern AI models:

1. **Parse the user's intent** - Understanding what information is needed
2. **Generate search queries** - Creating one or more web searches to find current information
3. **Execute the searches** - Querying the web for relevant results
4. **Synthesize the results** - Combining the information into a coherent response

Geogen captures step 2 and 3 - the actual search queries the AI generates and executes. These are your **Query Fanouts**.

## Example Query Fanouts

For a prompt like *"What are the best CRM tools for small businesses?"*, an AI might generate these query fanouts:

| Query | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `best CRM software small business 2024` | Find current rankings |
| `HubSpot CRM pricing` | Research specific product |
| `Salesforce small business reviews` | Gather user sentiment |
| `CRM comparison small teams` | Find comparison content |

## Why Query Fanouts Matter for GEO

Understanding Query Fanouts is crucial for **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** because they reveal:

### 1. 🔍 The Exact Searches AI Uses

Unlike traditional SEO where you guess which keywords users might search, Query Fanouts show you the **exact queries** AI models use to research your topic. This is the ground truth of how AI gathers information.

### 2. 📊 Content Gap Opportunities

If an AI is searching for `[your competitor] vs [your brand] comparison` but can't find quality comparison content, that's a content opportunity you can fill.

### 3. 🎯 Keyword Intelligence

Query Fanouts reveal the language patterns AI models use when researching topics. These patterns often differ from human search behavior, giving you unique optimization opportunities.

### 4. 📈 Brand Monitoring

See when and how often AI models are actively researching your brand, products, or industry. Spikes in query fanouts for your brand can indicate trending interest.

### 5. 🏆 Competitive Intelligence

Discover which competitors are being researched alongside your brand and understand the competitive landscape from the AI's perspective.

## Query Fanouts vs Citations

It's important to understand the difference between Query Fanouts and Citations:

| Aspect | Query Fanouts | Citations |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **What they are** | Search queries AI executes | URLs AI references in responses |
| **When they occur** | Before the response is generated | Within the final response |
| **What they show** | How AI researches topics | What sources AI trusts |
| **Optimization focus** | Content discoverability | Source authority |

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Cross-reference your Query Fanouts with Citations. If AI is searching for topics related to your brand but citing competitors, you have a clear optimization opportunity.
</Tip>
