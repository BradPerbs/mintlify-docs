## Overview

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and protect against abuse.

## Rate Limits

| Operation Type | Rate Limit | Scope |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| **Read** (GET requests) | 100 requests/min | Per API Key |
| **Write** (POST/DELETE requests) | 20 requests/min | Per API Key |
| **Entity Creation** | 10 entities/hour | Per Workspace |

## Rate Limit Response

When you exceed a rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Please slow down your requests.",
  "retryAfter": 30
}
```

The `Retry-After` header indicates how many seconds to wait before retrying.

## Handling Rate Limits

```python
import time
import requests

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 429:
    retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 60))
    time.sleep(retry_after)
    # Retry the request
```
