We show you exactly what happens when people ask AI assistants about your industry, your products, and your competitors. Getting started is straightforward: just set up your company profile, add the questions your customers are asking, and let GeoGen get to work.

<Info>
  Our platform interacts with AI models the same way a person does, by using their public websites. This guarantees the data you see is authentic and truly reflects the live user experience.
