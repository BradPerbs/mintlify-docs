Discover the background search queries that AI models perform to generate recommendations.

## What are Query Fanouts?

"Fanout Queries" are the specific searches AI models execute in the background whenever a user submits a prompt. These often differ significantly from the user's original question. Models may run searches on different engines or limit them to specific domains (e.g., `site:pcmag.com "search term"`).

Analyzing these queries helps you understand how AI models gather information and where your brand needs to be present to maximize recommendations. Additionally, they provide excellent headline ideas for future content on your company blog.

## Filtering Query Fanouts

You can filter fanout queries by search terms, date, tag, or model.

<Note>
  Currently, only Grok, ChatGPT, and Perplexity expose these background queries. We will add support for other models as soon as they make this data available.
