## Adding New Prompts

If you need to add more prompts after completing your initial onboarding configuration, navigate to the **Prompts** tab in the left-hand menu.

Click the **Create Prompts** dropdown menu and choose **Add Prompt** to create a single prompt and assign its specific language and region.

Alternatively, you can select **Suggest Prompts** from the dropdown to have the AI generate ideas, then choose your favorites from the suggested list.

You can also select **Bulk Upload** to import multiple prompts at once using a CSV file.

## Managing Tags

To keep things organized, you can create, add, or remove tags for your prompts. This allows you to easily filter your analytics by specific products or services later on.

## Editing Prompts

At any time, you can edit added or imported prompts. Simply check the boxes on the left side of a prompt to modify its text, language, or location.
