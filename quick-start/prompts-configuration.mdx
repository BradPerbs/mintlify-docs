This isn’t traditional SEO tracking. There’s no fixed ranking. AI models are probabilistic, so results can change slightly from day to day. That’s why GeoGen runs your prompts repeatedly, to surface patterns that matter, not one-off anomalies.

## About Prompts

People don’t “search” anymore.\
They _converse._

They’re not typing **“project management software.”**\
They’re asking **“What’s the best tool for keeping my remote team organized?”**

To win in AI results, your brand needs to show up in those conversational answers, either by being named directly or by having your content used as an implicit source.

GeoGen simulates these conversations across multiple AI models every 24 hours. Every run reveals which brands the AI prefers, how it justifies those recommendations, and whether _you_ are being positioned as a leader, or forgotten.
