## Adding your Competitors

GeoGen automatically detects and flags brands that frequently appear in your AI-generated results. By default, it displays a leaderboard ranking these brands by their visibility score, giving you an accurate snapshot of who dominates your space. If you’d like to adjust it, you can:

1. To select custom competitors to monitor, click on the **Select** button at the bottom of each competitor card on the **Manage Competitors** Slide
2. Click on the "**X**" icon which appears whilst hovering on each competitor card to remove it/hide it, this can be undone as needed just by going on the **Rejected** tab and clicking \*\*Restore \*\*at the bottom of each competitor card.
4. You can select as many competitors you wish from the **Manage Competitors** Slide, they will replace the default competitors on the leaderboard.
